Explanation of outbreak should include evidence from human and animal investigations and be logical. \nStep 11. Control measures will vary, depending on the disease and affected populations. Some interventions that can be applied to animals would not be applied to humans (for example, culling!) \nStep 12: Surveillance may need to be conducted in animal populations that are not under routine surveillance. \nStep 13.

This is consistent with usual incubation period of 1–7 days. \nOutbreak ongoing or likely to be over? Seems to be over \nOutliers (and possible explanations): Cases on 24th and 25th April occur much later than others. Perhaps they stored the meat and ate it at a later time? Perhaps they were exposed to different infected cows that died later? (Note that, in this outbreak investigation, these cases reported that they ate meat from the index cow on 11th April and stated that they did not eat meat from any other dead cow.)"
