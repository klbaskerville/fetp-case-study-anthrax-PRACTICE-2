# Appendix 2: Anthrax Fact Sheet 

## Anthrax epidemiology: a brief overview
Anthrax is an illness caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are endemic in the soil in certain areas of the world, where they persist as environmentally-resistant spores. Sporadically, the bacteria can cause outbreaks of illness in domestic and wild animals, and humans. Outbreaks in humans typically occur associated with outbreaks in animals.

Anthrax is exceptional in that it not contagious (spread between live animals or humans is insignificant). Herbivorous animals tend to acquire infection from eating soil-borne spores whilst grazing; this is a particular risk in areas where there is a previous history of anthrax occurrence, where infected carcasses are not managed appropriately, and after soil disturbance such as flooding, deep ploughing and excavation.Omnivorous and carnivorous animals tend to acquire the infection by eating infected animals, and humans may also acquire infection by handling infected animals and contaminated animal products. Milk is not an important mode of spread of infection.

The vegetative form of B. anthracis found in infected animals is fragile; however on exposure to air, it can form highly resistant spores, which remain viable for many years in some soil types. Appropriate management of infected carcasses is therefore important to minimise environmental contamination with spores, and thus the potential for future infections. Spores and vegetative bacteria are destroyed by moist heat at 100-105°C for 20 minutes.

## Anthrax in animals
Anthrax affects many domestic and wild animal species. In livestock, anthrax generally causes sudden death in cattle, sheep, goats and camelids; blood may be present around the nose, mouth and anus of carcasses. These species have high levels of septicaemia at death and the carcasses can contaminate the environment with spores. Appropriate management of carcasses of these species includes isolating the carcass from other animals, not opening the carcass (as exposure to oxygen allows spore formation), decontaminating the death site, and incineration or deep burial of the carcass.

In contrast, pigs have some degree of natural resistance to anthrax, and may recover from the disease. Clinical signs may include bloody faeces, haemorrhage from the nose and respiratory distress, or can be relatively mild with fever, enlarged lymph nodes and localised swelling.

Anthrax does not form a carrier state in animals (except possibly in recovered pigs, though the role they play in the epidemiology of anthrax is uncertain). Infection is primarily spread by movement of live animals in the incubation period, with death and release of bacteria from the carcass at the new site.

## Anthrax in humans
The three typical forms of clinical anthrax in humans are
• cutaneous anthrax, which can occur after penetration of spores through skin lesions, usually while handling contaminated animal products such as meat from an infected animal. The incubation period is typically 1–7 days, though it can be longer. Clinical signs may include a group of blisters with associated itching and swelling, progressing to a painless sore with a necrotic black scab (anthrax eschar). These lesions typically occur on hands, arms, face or neck. Given the lack of pain associated with the sores, people with cutaneous anthrax may not seek medical care.
• gastrointestinal anthrax, which can occur after eating raw or undercooked meat from infected animals. The incubation period is typically 3–7 days, though it can be longer. Clinical signs may include fever, swelling of glands in the neck, a sore throat, headache, nausea and vomiting (which may include blood), diarrhoea (which may include blood), abdominal swelling and fainting.
• inhalational (pulmonary) anthrax, which can occur if a person inhales B. anthracis spores, is typically associated with processing of contaminated animal hides, wool, etc., where spores may become aerosolised. The incubation period is typically 1–7 days, though it can be longer. Clinical signs may include fever, fatigue, aches, nausea and vomiting, chest discomfort, a cough and difficulty breathing.

Occasionally, other forms of anthrax can occur, including meningeal anthrax (often secondary to one of the above forms of anthrax) and injection anthrax (associated with use of contaminated needles).
