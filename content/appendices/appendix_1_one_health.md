# Appendix 1: Introduction to One Health 

## What is One Health?
One Health is about recognising the close relationship between people, animals and the environment, and the impact that poor health in one of these areas can have on the others.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines One Health as ‘a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach — working at the local, regional, national, and global levels — with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment’1. Though this approach is particularly relevant to control of diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans (‘zoonoses’), a One Health approach is also important for understanding other health challenges, such as antimicrobial resistance, food safety and security, and community and mental health issues arising from relationships with the environment in the face of environmental degradation and climate change.

One Health approaches are important for the prevention, investigation and control of zoonotic diseases. Early detection of zoonoses in animal populations can prevent transmission to humans (including by preventing introduction of these pathogens into the food chain, or mitigating the risk of the pathogens if introduced). For some zoonoses, control of infection in animal populations can be the most effective way to prevent disease in humans (e.g. anthrax, brucellosis, rabies, zoonotic Influenza A viruses). Given that approximately 60% of infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, and approximately 70% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, a ‘One Health’ approach to disease investigation and management is appropriate in many cases.

Investigating and controlling diseases at the human–animal–environment interface requires coordination and collaboration between different disciplines and agencies, at different levels.

## Which professions are involved in a One Health approach to zoonotic disease investigation and control?
Relevant professions include:
• Public health epidemiologists
• Veterinary epidemiologists
• Clinicians, pathologists, nurses and community health workers
• Veterinarians, animal health workers and quarantine officers
• Laboratory technicians
• Environmental scientists, ecologists and wildlife biologists

Several other professions have key roles in implementing One Health. For example, politicians have a role in developing policies that provide legislative support for disease investigation and control, including compensation schemes; economists have a role in evaluation of the economics of disease intervention strategies; sociologists have a role in understanding the drivers of human behaviour and social conditions that influence the occurrence of and response to outbreaks; and security personnel may have a role in supporting disease investigation and control measures.
