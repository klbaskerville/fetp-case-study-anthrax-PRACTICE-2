# Part B — Describing the Data

Based on the information collected to date, the obvious hypothesis was that the outbreak resulted from exposure to the cow that had died on the 11th of April. The team decided to conduct a cohort study to obtain more information on possible risk factors for this anthrax outbreak.

They developed a study questionnaire and visited all 57 households in the village. A total of 141 people from the 57 households (out of the 234 Kaplobotwo residents) responded to the questionnaire. The primary reason for non- response was absence from the village when the cohort study team visited, including children who were away at boarding school and adults who had travelled to neighbouring villages for trade, cattle rearing and farming.

The team collected data on demographics, clinical symptoms, and exposures that may be related to the outbreak occurrence.

During the cohort study, an additional 22 cases (for a total of 48 cases from Kaplobotwo) were identified. Forty-five cases met the suspected case definition and three met the confirmed case definition.

The team sketched out an analysis plan for the data they collected through surveillance, case finding, and the study.


[[Question_11]]


The FETP fellow reviewed the clinical features (signs and symptoms) among the 48 cases and classified them according to the outbreak case definitions for humans. Some cases had symptoms consistent with cutaneous anthrax, some had symptoms consistent with gastrointestinal anthrax, and some had both (see Table 3).

The FETP fellow also characterized the outbreak by time, using an epidemic curve 
(see Figure 2).

[[Question_14]]


The team entered the data from the cohort study (n=141) into a database, then analysed the data to identify possible risk factors for anthrax in humans.


[[Question_15]]


Answer 15 |

The district veterinary officer and his team traced meat from the implicated cow to buyers in two nearby villages, Tukumo and Rikwo. The RRT then followed up with the buyers and found:

in Tukumo village, approximately 23 people ate the meat (cooked) in a bar, but there were no reports of anyone becoming sick.

in Rikwo village, 28 people ate the meat (cooked) in a bar and none became sick, whilst two people who bought meat directly from the seller became sick.

The bar owners in Tukumo and Rikwo villages told the RRT that they boiled the meat for a long time. This may have destroyed any anthrax spores present, and diminished the risk of infection by eating the meat. In contrast, the people who bought the meat directly from the seller ate the meat roasted, which may not have been sufficient to reduce the risk of infection, given that anthrax spores are resistant to dry heat. From additional analyses of the Kaplobotwo cohort study data, the FETP fellow determined that boiling meat for more than 60 minutes was protective against anthrax (RR=0.49 for persons who boiled for 60 minutes or longer compared with those who boiled for less than 60 minutes).

Meanwhile, accumulating information from the district veterinary officer’s investigation indicated that over 150 suspected anthrax animal cases had occurred since 1st January 2018 in Ngenge subcounty. However, none of the interviewed livestock owners had vaccinated their animals against anthrax. The government did not subsidise vaccination, and many owners reported that vaccines were too expensive to purchase. Additionally, some animals were owned by groups or large extended families, which complicated decision-making on payment for vaccinations.
