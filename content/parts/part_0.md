# Anthrax in the Cattle-Keeping Corridor of Uganda: A One Health Case Study

**Instructor Guide – Do not distribute to participants**

# Learning objectives

After completing this case study, the participant should be able to:

- Describe the usual sequence of steps of the outbreak investigation, and how they might differ when investigating a zoonotic disease outbreak
- Define the One Health approach and its relevance to preventing and responding to zoonotic disease outbreaks
- List the multi-disciplinary team members required to effectively investigate and respond to a zoonotic disease outbreak, and describe the roles of each
- Calculate attack rates to identify possible exposures causing disease
- Identify strategies for joint control of disease in animals and people in the context of a zoonotic disease outbreak
- Describe challenges that can limit effective multisectoral coordination for outbreak investigation and control of zoonotic diseases


Instructor Notes

How to use FETP case studies: FETP case studies in applied epidemiology allow participants to practice applying epidemiologic skills in the classroom to address real-world public health problems. The case studies are used as a vital component of an applied epidemiology curriculum, rather than as stand-alone tools. They are ideally suited to reinforcing principles and skills already covered in a lecture or in background reading. 

This case study has an Instructor Guide and a Participant Guide. Each instructor should review the Instructor Guide, gain familiarity with the outbreak and investigation on which the case study is based, review the epidemiologic principles being taught, and think of examples in the instructor’s own experience to further illustrate the points. It would be helpful to include an animal health representative on the facilitation team, who can discuss challenges in responding to zoonotic disease outbreaks in animal populations and provide real- world insight into how this is done in their own country/context. 

During the case study session, one or two instructors facilitate the case study for 8 to 20 participants in a classroom or conference room. The Participant Guide includes background text and questions. The instructor should direct a participant to read one paragraph of the text or a question aloud, then progress around the room and give each participant a chance to read. Reading aloud and in turns has two advantages. First, all participants engage in the process and overcome any inhibitions by having their voice heard. Second, it keeps all participants progressing through the case study at the same speed. After a participant reads a question, the instructor will direct participants to answer the question by engaging in a discussion (in small groups or as a whole group) or performing calculations. 
 
At the end of the case study, the instructor should direct a participant to once again read the learning objectives to review and ensure that the objectives have been met. 

Prerequisites: For this case study, participants should have received instruction or conducted readings on outbreak investigation. This includes defining an outbreak, constructing a case definition, developing a case investigation form and calculating attack rates. 

Options for modification: Extra time can be allowed at the start of the case study to review the background reading on One Health (Appendix 1). Instructors could also provide the handout on anthrax (Appendix 2) as pre-reading. 

Target audience: Trainees in Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs), public health students, public health workers who may participate in rapid needs assessments, and others who are interested in this topic. 

Level of case study: Frontline

Time required: Approximately 3.5 hours

Instructor’s Note | Provide Appendix 1 (background reading on One Health) to participants the day before this module is held.
