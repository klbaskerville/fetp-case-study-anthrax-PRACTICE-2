# Part A: Background and Initial Investigation

## 20th April 2018
On Friday 20th April 2018, seven people presented to a health centre in Kween District, Uganda with swollen skin blisters and lesions with black tissue in the centre. The attending clinician, Dr. K, was concerned by the number of patients with the same clinical features. In response, Dr. K called the Kween District Health Officer. Dr. K reported that all patients lived in the village of Kaplobotwo (subcounty Ngenge, Kween District, Uganda). Six patients were males between the ages of 14 and 62; one was a three-year-old female. All seven had been involved in skinning, butchering, carrying or eating a cow that had died suddenly on 11th April in Kaplobotwo.

## Question 1

## Setting
Kaplobotwo is located in Kween district, a mountainous area that is part of the ‘cattle-keeping corridor’ of Uganda. Kween shares a border with the Republic of Kenya to the south (Figure 1). Road access is limited to some areas of the district. 

Approximately 85% of households in Kween district depend on subsistence farming for their livelihood; over 80% raise livestock. Cattle and goats are common, along with sheep, pigs and poultry. Of the approximately 100,000 people living in Kween district, over half are under 18 years of age, and approximately one-third are illiterate. Fewer than 2% of households own a television but about half of households own a radio, which serves as the main source of information in the area. 
 
At the time of this cluster, the village of Kaplobotwo had 234 residents, of whom 127 were males and 138 were less than 18 years old.

## The field investigation
The Kween District Health Officer immediately called a meeting with the District Rapid Response Team (RRT), which included a fellow in Uganda’s Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP).

## Question 2

## 21st April 2018 
The RRT consisted of the FETP fellow, a health promotion officer, a laboratory technician, the district veterinary officer, two environmental health officers and the District Administrator. 
 
On the 21st April, the RRT met with the District Health Officer, then travelled to Ngenge to start the field investigation.

The team met with the village leader to discuss possible exposures, including exposure to the dead cow linked to the seven clinic patients. The village leader reported that the cow had died suddenly, and was butchered shortly afterwards. In total, 15 Kaplobotwo residents were involved in butchering the cow and carrying its meat.

Additional Kaplobotwo village residents reportedly ate some of the meat. Some meat was also sold to neighbouring villages.

The RRT visited the Ngenge health centre and met with Dr. K, who provided clinical case notes for review. The presumptive diagnosis was anthrax, given the patients’ characteristic skin lesions, reported contact with a cow that had died suddenly, and a history of anthrax outbreaks in the region. Before proceeding, the team refreshed their knowledge of anthrax (see Appendix 2 for more information about anthrax).

## Question 3

## Table 1. Steps of an Outbreak Investigation
At this stage, the RRT reviewed the steps of an outbreak investigation.

## Questions 4-5


To verify the suspected diagnosis, the laboratory technician recommended collecting samples from the skin lesions and testing them for anthrax, with the patients’ consent. Specimens from all seven patients were collected, packaged and sent to the National Reference Laboratory in Kampala, with PCR testing for anthrax to be run as an urgent priority. 

The RRT’s next steps were to develop a case definition, develop a case investigation form for this outbreak, and look for additional cases.

## Question 6


Given the high index of suspicion for anthrax, the FETP fellow developed the following case definitions for human anthrax: 

Clinical 
• Suspected cutaneous anthrax case: onset of itching, reddening or swelling of skin areas and any of the following: skin lesions (e.g. papule, vesicle or eschar) or lymphadenopathy 
• Suspected gastrointestinal anthrax case: onset of abdominal pain and any of the following: diarrhea, vomiting, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, or oropharyngeal lesions 
• Confirmed anthrax case: A suspected case with PCR-positivity for Bacillus anthracis from a clinical sample (swab from skin lesions or vesicles, and/or blood sample) 

Time: with onset from 6th April onwards 

Place, Person: in a person residing in Kaplobotwo village, Kween District

## Questions 7-8

The FETP fellow identified five additional possible cases through speaking with community leaders. Members of the RRT interviewed the 12 suspected case-patients using the case investigation form. Meanwhile, the health promotion officer met with Kaplobotwo community health workers to start community engagement and mobilization. The initial focus was on learning about community practices related to the management of animals that have died suddenly, their beliefs and understanding of why villagers had fallen sick, and the most effective means of village communication. In addition, the health promotions officer trained community health workers to use visual aids to educate villagers about anthrax prevention.

Meanwhile, the district veterinary officer, his team, and the village leader visited the owner of the cow that was linked to the initial cases. Given the high suspicion of anthrax, the district veterinary officer and his team decontaminated the cow’s death site and butchering site using formalin (10% concentration). They vaccinated all livestock that had access to these sites and advised the owner on managing anthrax risk in livestock. The team reported the suspicions of anthrax to neighbouring livestock owners, and vaccinated all livestock deemed at risk of infection. Owners were asked to monitor their animals and report sudden deaths.

The district veterinary officer and his team formulated the following cattle case definitions for use in this outbreak:
• Suspected anthrax cattle case: sudden death, or death within 24 hours of illness onset, with or without blood-stained discharges from external orifices, in cattle in Kaplobotwo village from 6th April onwards.
• Confirmed anthrax cattle case: a suspected cattle case with Bacillus anthracis identified in clinical sample (blood, oedematous fluid or exudate) by bacterial culture, PCR or microscopic examination of blood smears.

The district veterinary officer also reviewed district veterinary anthrax records for anthrax occurrence in livestock in the area during the previous 4 months.

## Question 9

## Table 2. Timeline: 11th to 30th April
Table 2 is a timeline of key events from 11th April to 30th April.

## 22nd April 2018 
In a meeting of the RRT, the district veterinary officer reported that another cow died suddenly in the same area where the first cow died. A blood sample was taken and sent to the National Reference Laboratory for PCR testing. Under the supervision of the district veterinary officer, the carcass was buried to minimise the potential for infection of humans and environmental contamination with anthrax spores. The death site was decontaminated. Given the frequency of movement and trade of meat and movement of live animals between villages, the FETP fellow worked with neighbouring village leaders to arrange training for community health workers in active case finding in humans, who may have been exposed to infected animals or meat that were moved from Kaplobotwo to neighbouring villages.

Meanwhile, the environmental health officers advised the investigation team on environmental routes of anthrax transmission, including soil conditions favourable to persistence of anthrax spores, the potential for spread by local waterways, and the possibility of wildlife being affected.

## Question 10a

## 23rd – 29th April 2018 
On the 23rd April, seven additional cows were found dead in an area neighbouring that of the previous cow cases — one carcass was found on a pasture, and six were found in the nearby water stream and surrounding bushes. On 29th April 2018, another cow was found dead in Kaplobotwo. The district veterinary officer was notified, and samples were collected from these cows, with appropriate management of the carcasses. Further interviews were conducted with local livestock owners about their livestock management practices. 

On receiving positive laboratory test results for B. anthracis from the cattle samples, the district veterinary officer reported the confirmed cases to the RRT, as well as the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.

## Question 10b

## 30th April 2018 
By the 30th April, 26 suspected human cases had been identified and interviewed using the case investigation form. All 26 suspected cases reported onset of symptoms after contact with the cow that died on 11th April. Reported contact included skinning, butchering, and carrying and eating meat from the dead cow. Only 10 of the 26 cases had sought care at the health centre. It was suggested that the low rate of care-seeking may have been related to a recent outbreak of Marburg virus (October 2017), after which some members of the community had begun to fear going to the health centre. These fears included dying at the health centre, being sprayed with disinfectant, having their home quarantined, and being stigmatised as a suspected Marburg case.
