# Part C — Response

Although control measures were initiated throughout the investigation (as soon as appropriate), the public health and animal health investigation teams met on 30th April to discuss findings so far and to formulate a concerted plan of action. The findings included:

Human cases started on 13th April 2018 and were from Kaplobotwo village in Kween district.

Twenty six cases in humans were identified either as index cases or through active case finding; a further 22 human cases were identified through the cohort study.

The most likely cause was anthrax, based on signs and symptoms in affected humans and cattle, history of association between affected humans and cattle, and laboratory findings

The first suspected cattle case (linked to the index human cases) occurred on 11th April 2018. Ten cattle were suspected or confirmed to have died of anthrax in Kaplobotwo during the investigation period.

Retrospective investigation identified over 150 suspected anthrax cases in cattle from 1st January to 30th April 2018 in Ngenge subcounty.

Livestock in the affected area were not routinely vaccinated.

Control measures are a vital part of outbreak response and should be implemented as soon as possible. However, it is also important to understand the context when planning, implementing and evaluating control measures. As the investigation progressed, the team learned more about the social and economic context of the outbreak, and how that may impact disease control measures.
