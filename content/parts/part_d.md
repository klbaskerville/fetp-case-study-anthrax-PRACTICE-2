# Part D — Conclusion

This outbreak of anthrax in animals and people in the ‘cattle-keeping corridor’ of Uganda highlights the need for coordinated investigations and response by public and animal health authorities for suspected zoonotic disease outbreaks. This case study highlights how a One Health approach can improve the effectiveness of the response. In this outbreak, all human cases were linked to exposure to a single cow death. Community health education campaigns and appropriate management of infected carcasses subsequent to the index cow death may have contributed to preventing further human anthrax cases, as no human cases were linked to these subsequent cow deaths. Vaccination of susceptible animals in the area is likely to have also helped prevent cases in cattle.

Based on what they learned from working together in a multidisciplinary team, the outbreak team decided to form a Kween District One Heath taskforce to focus on improving information sharing between animal and human health to support the prevention of, detection of and response to zoonotic disease outbreaks in Kween district in the future.
