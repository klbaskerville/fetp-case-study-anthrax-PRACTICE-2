Interactive case study on anthrax for trainees in Field Epidemiology Training Programs

FETP case studies in applied epidemiology allow participants to practice applying epidemiologic skills in the classroom to address real-world public health problems. The case studies are used as a vital component of an applied epidemiology curriculum, rather than as stand-alone tools. They are ideally suited to reinforcing principles and skills already covered in a lecture or in background reading.

Target audience: Trainees in Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs), public health students, public health workers who may participate in rapid needs assessments, and others who are interested in this topic.
